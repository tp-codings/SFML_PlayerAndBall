# PlayerAndBall
A Player has to move a rectangle across the screen to eat some circles - except the read ones - to get points (based on the [SFML Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BySDfVNljG8&list=PL6xSOsbVA1eb_QqMTTcql_3PdOiE928up) by Suraj Sharma.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites and basic information

- This application is tested in windows 10/11
- This repo does not provide an executable -> you have to compile your own (I used Visual Studio)
- I don't guarantee that every corner case has been taken into account. The project is part of my learning process for C++ and SFML
- All dependencies are included in this repo, so it is almost plug and play :)

## Installation

1. Clone Repository
`git clone <https://github.com/tp-codings/SFML_PLayerAndBall.git`>
2. Build Executable (e.g. Visual Studio)
